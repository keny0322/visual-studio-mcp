## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this MCP server seriously, especially given its access to local Visual Studio processes and COM automation interfaces.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities can put users at risk before a patch is available.

Instead, please report it via the following method:

**Email:** Send details to **alon@miniforge.studio**  
**Private Advisory:** use the Private Advisory feature to submit a report directly to the us.

### Information to Include: 
* Description of the vulnerability (e.g., improper COM object handling, unauthenticated command execution).
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any relevant trace logs or call stacks.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will provide a timeline for a fix.
