## 📋 What is visual-studio-mcp?

visual-studio-mcp is a helper tool designed to connect AI programs like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini to Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and 2026. It runs a server called MCP that works behind the scenes. The server helps automate tasks like testing code, finding bugs, and managing builds. It uses a special Windows technology called COM to talk directly with Visual Studio.

You do not need any programming skills to use visual-studio-mcp. This tool makes your coding experience smarter by adding AI-powered help for common tasks inside Visual Studio.
